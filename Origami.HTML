            Hello everybody Origami is my most favourite hobby.
            Oringami also called paper folding, art of folding objects out of paper to create both two-dimensional and three-dimensional subjects.
            Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China. 
            It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, 
            so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather,
            Architecture and Civil Engineering: Origami is used in the manufacturing of miniature models of bridges and stadiums. 
            Medicine: Paper folding techniques are used to embody the cell membrane and protein, and are used in modeling DNA samples.
            There are now many types of origami. In a recent, informal survey, origami enthusiasts have come up with over "80" different types of origami.
